# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction 🩺

Welcome to the **Breast Cancer Prediction** project! This machine learning project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using a variety of classification algorithms. 🧬✨

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To accurately predict **breast cancer diagnosis** using machine learning models trained on features extracted from breast cancer data.

---

## 📊 Models Used

We applied and compared the performance of the following classification models:

- 🌳 **Decision Tree (DT)**
- 📈 **Logistic Regression (LG)**
- 🧮 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ✅ *Best Accuracy: **97%***
- 🐦 **Naive Bayes (NB)**
- 🌲 **Random Forest (RF)**

Among all models, **SVM** outperformed others with the **highest accuracy of 97%**. 🏆

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools Used

Here are the key tools and technologies used in this project:

1. 🐍 **Python 3**
2. 📚 **Pandas** – Data manipulation
3. 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
4. 🤖 **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning models
5. 🔍 **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development
6. 💾 **NumPy** – Numerical operations
7. 📁 **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

We used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset** available from:
> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html

This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix. Here's a summary:

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Decision Tree       | 92%      |
| Logistic Regression | 95%      |
| SVM (Best)          | **97%**  |
| Naive Bayes         | 93%      |
| Random Forest       | 96%      |
